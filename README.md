Projects Overview
1. Image Extraction
Description: Extract meaningful data from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV.
Applications: Document digitization, image classification, and feature extraction.
2. Object Detection
Description: Detect objects in images using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and PyTesseract for text recognition. OpenCV is used for preprocessing and postprocessing.
Applications: Retail inventory management, surveillance, and object tracking.
3. Number Plate Recognition
Description: Use EasyOCR to identify and extract number plates from vehicle images.
Applications: Automated traffic management and vehicle registration identification.
4. ATCC (Automatic Traffic Count and Classification)
Description: Use YOLO and OpenCV to count and classify vehicles (cars, trucks, bikes) in real-time traffic videos.
Applications: Traffic analytics and smart city solutions.
